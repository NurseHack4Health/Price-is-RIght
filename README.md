# Price-is-RIght
I am a semi retired RN, working per diem.  I would like to see a nursing model using retired nurses to perform certain nursing functions within the Team Nurse framework. Instead of dollar per hour as we do now,  a retired RN with active license would bid to do certain function based on a wage offered by the facility.  For example, $10 per dressing change. This will relieve some load off the full time staff.  Of course, this will not work in union hospitals. I think many retired RNs would like to stay involved in patient care but are only willing to do certain functions in their own time with lower wages then they used to prior to retirement. Team nursing seems to work out well during the COVID-19 pandemic and I would not be surprised if this is the nursing model going forward,

For disclosure, I do have a website called TheRetiredNurse.com to explore opportunities like the one I propose above.
